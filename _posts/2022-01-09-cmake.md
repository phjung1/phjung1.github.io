## What this book covers

we have written this book as a progressive sequence of task and recipes. at each point, we introduce enough information about Cmake to show how to achiev our goals, without overwhelming you with details. By the end of the book. you will be able to tackle increasingly complex operations and leverage the contents of the recipes in your own real-world projects with confidence.



We will cover these topics:

- Configure, build, test, and install code projects using Cmake

- Detect poerationg system, processors, libraries, files, and programs for conditional compilation

- Increase the portability of your code

- Refactor a large code base into modules with the help of CMake

- Build multi-language proejcts

- Know where and how to tweak CMake configuration files written by domebody else

- Package proejcts for distribution

- Port projects to Cmake



The workflow of a project managaed by Cmake happens in a bumber of stages,

which we refer to as tomes.These can be summarized neatly in the following figure:

- Cmake time or configure time: this is when Cmake is running . in this phase Cmake will process the CmakeList.txt files in your project and configure it.

- Generation time: Upon successful configuration, Cmake will ghenerate the scripts needed by the native build tools to perform subsquent steps in the project.

- **Build time**. This is when the native build tools are invoked on the platform- and tool-native build scripts previously generated by CMake. At this point, the compiler will be invoked and the targets (executables and libraries) will be built in a specific build directory. Note the recursive CMake-time arrow: this can seem baffling, but it is a mechanism we will use many times throughout the book to achieve a truly platform-independent build.

- **CTest time** or **test time**. This is when we run the test suite of the project to check whether the targets perform as intended.

- **CDash time** or **report time**. This is when the results of testing the project are uploaded to a dashboard to be shared with other developers.

- **Install time**. This is when the project's targets, source files, executables, and libraries are installed from the build directory to an install location.

- **CPack time** or **packaging time**. This is when we package our project for distribution, either as source code or binary.

- **Package install time**. This is when the newly minted package is installed system-wide.
